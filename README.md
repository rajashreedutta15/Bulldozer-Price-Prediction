# Bulldozer-Price-Prediction

The project is based on the "price" of the bulldozers and mainly focuses on the timing of the sale. The evaluation consisted of predicting the price of a bulldozer using the test data provided. It was a datetime regression problem, so we used multiple models to train on which random forest regression model showed the best price prediction performance.
